Problem: Find the Second Largest Number Description: Write a program that reads a list of integers and finds the second largest number in the list. Input Format: The first line contains an integer 𝑁 N ( 2 ≤ 𝑁 ≤ 1 0 5 ) (2≤N≤10 5 ), the number of elements in the list. The second line contains 𝑁 N space-separated integers ( − 1 0 9 ≤ 𝑎 𝑖 ≤ 1 0 9 ) (−10 9 ≤a i ​ ≤10 9 ). Output Format: Print the second largest number in the list.
